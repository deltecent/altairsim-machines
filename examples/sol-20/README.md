# Sol-20 cassette games

A Processor Technology **Sol-20** with a 1977 game in the cassette deck. Four of them, each in its
own machine file — pick one and run it:

```
altairsim trek80.toml        # TREK80  -- Star Trek
altairsim atc.toml           # ATC     -- Air Traffic Controller
altairsim pacman.toml        # PAC-MAN
altairsim raiders.toml       # RAIDERS
```

**The game loads itself.** Each file mounts the cassette, types the SOLOS command that runs it, and
boots — so after the tape finishes loading (about the minute a real cassette took, at the Sol's own
speed) the game comes up. TREK80 asks for a speed factor and starts; the others run straight away.

You do not have to type anything — but on a real Sol-20 you would, and the machine files simply do
it for you. At the SOLOS `>` prompt you would enter `XE` and the file's five-character name; a
`TYPE` line in each `startup` queues exactly that, and SOLOS reads it as type-ahead at its first
prompt, as if the keys had been pressed. The names, for when you `XE` one yourself after a `REW`:

| Game | Command |
|---|---|
| TREK80 | `XE TRK80` |
| ATC | `XE ATC` |
| PAC-MAN | `XE PACMA` — SOLOS names are five characters |
| RAIDERS | `GE RAID`, then `EX 100` — see below |

**RAIDERS needs two commands, because its tape names the wrong start address.** A SOLOS tape
header carries a load address and an execute address, and `XE` jumps to the execute address when
the load ends. The RAIDERS header says load `0100`, execute `0000` — but nothing on the tape loads
at `0000`, so a plain `XE RAID` loads the game correctly and then runs whatever RAM held there.
SOLOS comes back with a bare `>` and no game. `GE RAID` loads the tape without running it, and
`EX 100` starts the game at its real entry point.

`raiders.toml` still types `XE RAID` for you: before it boots, it deposits `JMP 0100` at address 0
(`DEPOSIT 0000 C3 00 01`), so the jump to `0000` lands on the game. That jump stays in memory, so
`XE RAID` also works after a `REW` — until the game or a power cycle overwrites it. The two
commands always work.

## What you are looking at

The Sol-20 is not an Altair with a terminal on it — it is an integrated computer with a
**keyboard and a screen built in**, and that changes what this looks like on your terminal. The
screen is a **VDM-1**, memory-mapped video at `0CC00H`–`0CFFFH`, and nothing it displays reaches
your terminal: SOLOS signs on, `XE` echoes, and the game paints its starfield all into that video
memory. With SDL3 you get a **window**, in the VDM-1's own character font, and you watch it there.
Built without SDL the machine still runs perfectly and the console stays quiet — that quiet is
correct. Your typing goes the other way and does work: keystrokes reach the Sol's keyboard port.

Headless, you can still read what the game painted: stop the machine with `^E` and dump the VDM's
memory. Each row is 64 bytes, and `DUMP … WIDTH=64` prints the ASCII beside the hex, so one screen
row is one line. For TREK80:

```
altairsim> DUMP CD00-CD3F WIDTH=64
CD00  43 4F 50 59 52 49 47 48 54 ... 43 4F 52 50 2E  COPYRIGHT (C) 1977  PROCESSOR TECHNOLOGY CORP.

altairsim> DUMP CFC0-CFFF WIDTH=64
CFC0  45 4E 54 45 52 20 53 50 ... 54 29 29           ENTER SPEED FACTOR (9(SLOW)-0(FAST))
```

That is the game's own copyright line off a 1977 tape, and the row where it stops to ask you
something — read straight out of the screen it drew them on. `RUN` resumes, and the answer you
type reaches the game. `^E` (STOP) takes the keyboard back to the monitor at any point; the
machine is not disturbed by stopping it.

**The clock is 2.045 MHz**, the stock Sol-20 — the 14.31818 MHz dot clock divided by 7 (Sol Systems
Manual, Theory of Operation §VIII). Everywhere else in this simulator the default is flat out; here
the real speed is set on purpose, because these are games and they were played at that speed. It is
also why the tape takes a real minute to load. `SET cpu0 clock_hz=0` puts it back to flat out.

To play a game a second time, rewind first — nothing inside the guest can wind a tape back:

```
REW sol0:tape1
XE TRK80
```

## The files

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `trek80.toml` · `atc.toml` · `pacman.toml` · `raiders.toml` | The four machines: `base = "sol20"`, a tape, the launch keystrokes, and the clock. `raiders.toml` also deposits the jump at address 0. |
| `TRK80.WAV` · `ATC.WAV` · `PACMAN.WAV` · `RAIDERS.WAV` | **The tapes.** Sol-20 cassettes digitized by Philip Lord (hosted on deramp.com) — real CUTS audio at 1200 baud, decoded the way the hardware did. |
| `TRK80.TAP` | TREK80 as a byte stream, decoded from `TRK80.WAV`. `MOUNT sol0:tape1 "TRK80.TAP"` skips the audio and loads the same game. |
| `Trek80 Manual.pdf` · `ATC Manual.pdf` | The game manuals — commands, displays, and scoring — from Processor Technology and Creative Computing. |
| `TREK80.ENT` | A SOLOS `ENTER` script from the archive. The source for the tape-writing demonstration below. |
| `make-trek80-tape.sh` | A demonstration: it has SOLOS write its own tape from `TREK80.ENT`. |

**The tapes are Philip Lord's real recordings, and reading them is the point.** Each `.WAV` decodes
to a valid SOLOS tape with **zero framing errors** — for TREK80 the header names `TRK80`, its `SIZE`
is `1EA0`, and its checksum is `D9`, all matching the archived `ENTER` script byte for byte. That
did not used to work: an earlier decoder garbled these exact recordings (dozens of framing errors,
most of the payload wrong), and the TREK80 example tape had to be *synthesized* from the `.ENT`
instead. The demodulator now reads the real cassettes, so the real cassettes are what ship.

The synthesis is kept as `make-trek80-tape.sh` because it demonstrates the one thing a SOLOS tape
cannot fake: a SOLOS cassette carries a header checksum and one after every 256-byte block, and a
tape whose checksums are wrong is *invisible* — `CA` lists nothing and `GE` never finds the file.
The script has SOLOS `SA`ve the image so the checksums are the machine's own arithmetic; it writes
to a separate `TRK80-solos.*` so it never overwrites the shipped recording, and it proves the two
agree — SOLOS computes the same `D9` header checksum the real tape carries.
